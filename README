## orbitals - write simple unittests which can be run against any supernova environment in a threaded manner

orbitals does the following:
* uses rackerhacker's supernova to allow running tests against any supernova configured environment
* testcases have access to an object specific python-novaclient instance through self.client
* allows green threading at both the testcase and suite level using gevent, allowing multiple suites to be run concurrently and/or suites with multiple concurrent tests

### Installation

    git clone git://github.com/tr3buchet/orbitals.git
    cd orbitals
    python setup.py install

### Configuration

    Please refer to http://github.com/rackerhack/supernova for instructions setting up supernova
    No other setup is required


### Usage

    orbitals [--help] [--debug] [--list] environment testcase

    positional arguments:
    env          environment to run tests against, from ~/.supernova
    testcase     orbitals testcase to run

    optional arguments:
    -h, --help   show this help message and exit
    -l, --list   list configured environments
    -d, --debug  show debug output (overrides NOVACLIENT_DEBUG)


    to use an included testcase:
    orbitals environment orbitals.testcases.testcase_file.TestCaseClass

    write your own testcases:
    orbitals environment testcase_file.TestCaseClass

#### A brief note about environment variables

    Orbitals does not use previously set environment variables.
    Please see the supernova readme for more information.
